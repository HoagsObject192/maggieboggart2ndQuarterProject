            <p>
                Jairo himself is a HUGEEEEEEE food enthusiast. It may not look like it but this 
                guy eats ALOT; in a good way, meaning he has always had a value of apprecciating food.
                His interest in cooking is inspired by his family, (and also for the sake of having
                in his terms "aura"). Jairo also enjoys cooking for, and in front of his friends,
                always putting on a show. As good humored person, Jairo likes entertaining while cooking good food ( his favourite is steak)
                and so he sometimes puts on cooking shows when on vc with his friends. Of course,  aside from the entertainment
                Jairo also cooks tasty food (even if maggie once watched him claim a raw steak was cooked). He saw this site
                as another opportunity to show his appreciation for food.

            <h3>site creator: maggie tan</h3>
            <p>
                Maggie grew up in a family that LOVES cooking. Her grandma is a baker with her own 
                bakeshop, and her dad, well..2. aside from being the franchiser of a fast food company,
                is also a huge food enthusiast. As you can imagine, not a week goes by without Maggie 
                receiving freshly baked goods from her grandma or her dad experimenting on food for 
                dinner. This inspired Maggie to get into culinary, specifically baking, and 
                eventually she grew into a determined recipe collector. She wanted to find a way to 
                present the recipes she has collected in a way that was more accessible given the 
                present period, and this cs project gave her the oppurtunity to do so.
